Come visit our stall at the Rotary Kmart Markets, held in the Kmart carpark on the third Sunday of every month (January through November). We have a broad range of materials addressing interesting and thought provoking questions, such as:

  * [If God is good, why is there death and suffering?](https://creation.com/why-is-there-death-and-suffering "Why is there death and suffering? by Ken Ham and Dr Jonathan Sarfati")
  * [Where did Cain get his wife?](https://creation.com/where-did-cain-get-his-wife)
  * [How do dinosaurs and fossils fit with the Bible?](https://creation.com/you-dont-fit-dinosaurs-with-the-bible "You Don’t ‘Fit’ Dinosaurs With The Bible!")
  * [Has evolution really proved the Bible wrong?](https://creation.com/did-humans-evolve-from-apes "Did humans evolve from apes?")
  * [Where did all the different “races” come from?](https://creation.com/the-origin-of-the-human-races "The origin of the human races")
  * [Is there any hope beyond heartache and pain?](https://creation.com/the-lost-path-to-the-roman-road "The Lost Path to the Roman Road")

<br>See you there!

If you have any questions, please feel free to contact one of our pastors:
