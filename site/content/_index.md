  heading: Welcome
  text: >-
    We are a group of Christians seeking to fellowship according to the pattern
    set by the early church, which met in their homes (Rom 16:5; 1 Cor 16:19;
    Col 4:15; Phm 2; 2 Thess 2:15; 1 Cor 11:2) and encouraged everyone to
    participate (1 Cor 14:26; Eph 5:19; Col 3:16).


    We meet at various locations around Gladstone, Calliope and Tannum Sands,
    and our Sunday meetings typically include:

    +Encouraging one another in song, Scripture & testimonies (1 Cor 14:26; Eph
    5:19; Col 3:16; 1 Tim 4:13).

    +Breaking up into small groups for prayer & encouragement (1 Cor 14:15, 26;
    Col 4:2–4). 

    +Bible teaching led by gifted men (1 Cor 14:26–35; 2 Tim 2:2; James 3:1).

    +A monthly celebration of the Lord’s Supper as a full meal (1 Cor 11:17–33;
    Acts 20:7).


    We believe that Jesus is the head of the church, which is his body (Eph
    1:22–23). Major church decisions are prayerfully made under the headship of
    Christ by elder-led congregational consensus (Acts 15:22; 1 Thess 5:12–13;
    Heb 13:17). As a body, we encourage one another according to our spiritual
    gifts (1 Cor 12 to14), promoting genuine relationships and a family
    atmosphere with parents and children worshiping together. 


    The early church was also burdened for those who do not yet know Jesus (1
    Cor 14:22–25), and so we are encouraged to be evangelistic in every area of
    life, impacting our community and culture for Christ (Col 4:5–6; 1 Pet
    3:15–16; Luke 14:13, 21, 23). 


    In essentials there is to be unity, in nonessentials liberty, and in all
    things love. With regard to the essentials, all of us who participate in and
    contribute to our church meetings firmly uphold and bind ourselves to the
    following core truths of the Christian faith:

    +The Bible is the Word of God and without error.

    +There is one God, eternally existing as the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.

    +God is good and created a perfect world.

    +Adam’s sin brought death and suffering and separation from God.

    +Jesus is fully God and fully man, born of the virgin Mary, and without sin.

    +Jesus died on a cross to pay the penalty for our sins and conquered death
    through his resurrection.

    +We must repent and turn to God and take up our own cross daily to be a
    disciple of Jesus.

    +We are saved by God’s grace through faith in Jesus, not by our good deeds.

    +Jesus will one day return to judge the world and establish his Messianic
    kingdom.

    +There will be a new heavens and a new earth, restored to their original
    perfection.
