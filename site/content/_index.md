    [Luke 14:13]: https://biblehub.com/niv/luke/14-13.htm "But when you give a
    banquet, invite the poor, the crippled, the lame, the blind,"

    [Luke 14:21]: https://biblehub.com/niv/luke/14-21.htm "“The servant came
    back and reported this to his master. Then the owner of the house became
    angry and ordered his servant, ‘Go out quickly into the streets and alleys
    of the town and bring in the poor, the crippled, the blind and the lame.’"

    [Luke 14:23]: https://biblehub.com/niv/luke/14-23.htm "“Then the master told
    his servant, ‘Go out to the roads and country lanes and compel them to come
    in, so that my house will be full."

    [Acts 15:22]: https://biblehub.com/niv/acts/15-22.htm "Then the apostles and
    elders, with the whole church, decided to choose some of their own men and
    send them to Antioch with Paul and Barnabas. They chose Judas (called
    Barsabbas) and Silas, men who were leaders among the believers."

    [Acts 20:7]: https://biblehub.com/niv/acts/20-7.htm "On the first day of the
    week we came together to break bread. Paul spoke to the people and, because
    he intended to leave the next day, kept on talking until midnight."

    [Rom 16:5]: https://biblehub.com/niv/romans/16-5.htm "Greet also the church
    that meets at their house."

    [1 Cor 11:2]: https://biblehub.com/niv/1_corinthians/11-2.htm "I praise you
    for remembering me in everything and for holding to the traditions just as I
    passed them on to you."

    [1 Cor 11:17–33]: https://biblehub.com/niv/1_corinthians/11-17.htm "In the
    following directives I have no praise for you, for your meetings do more
    harm than good. In the first place, I hear that when you come together as a
    church, there are divisions among you, and to some extent I believe it. No
    doubt there have to be differences among you to show which of you have God’s
    approval. So then, when you come together, it is not the Lord’s Supper you
    eat, for when you are eating, some of you go ahead with your own private
    suppers. As a result, one person remains hungry and another gets drunk.
    Don’t you have homes to eat and drink in? Or do you despise the church of
    God by humiliating those who have nothing? What shall I say to you? Shall I
    praise you? Certainly not in this matter! For I received from the Lord what
    I also passed on to you: The Lord Jesus, on the night he was betrayed, took
    bread, and when he had given thanks, he broke it and said, “This is my body,
    which is for you; do this in remembrance of me.” In the same way, after
    supper he took the cup, saying, “This cup is the new covenant in my blood;
    do this, whenever you drink it, in remembrance of me.” For whenever you eat
    this bread and drink this cup, you proclaim the Lord’s death until he comes.
    So then, whoever eats the bread or drinks the cup of the Lord in an unworthy
    manner will be guilty of sinning against the body and blood of the Lord.
    Everyone ought to examine themselves before they eat of the bread and drink
    from the cup. For those who eat and drink without discerning the body of
    Christ eat and drink judgment on themselves. That is why many among you are
    weak and sick, and a number of you have fallen asleep. But if we were more
    discerning with regard to ourselves, we would not come under such judgment.
    Nevertheless, when we are judged in this way by the Lord, we are being
    disciplined so that we will not be finally condemned with the world. So
    then, my brothers and sisters, when you gather to eat, you should all eat
    together."

    [1 Cor 12 to 14]: https://biblehub.com/niv/1_corinthians/12.htm "(too large
    to display)"

    [1 Cor 14:15]: https://biblehub.com/niv/1_corinthians/14-15.htm "So what
    shall I do? I will pray with my spirit, but I will also pray with my
    understanding; I will sing with my spirit, but I will also sing with my
    understanding."

    [1 Cor 14:22–25]: https://biblehub.com/niv/1_corinthians/14-22.htm "Tongues,
    then, are a sign, not for believers but for unbelievers; prophecy, however,
    is not for unbelievers but for believers. So if the whole church comes
    together and everyone speaks in tongues, and inquirers or unbelievers come
    in, will they not say that you are out of your mind? But if an unbeliever or
    an inquirer comes in while everyone is prophesying, they are convicted of
    sin and are brought under judgment by all, as the secrets of their hearts
    are laid bare. So they will fall down and worship God, exclaiming, “God is
    really among you!”"

    [1 Cor 14:26]: https://biblehub.com/niv/1_corinthians/14-26.htm "What then
    shall we say, brothers and sisters? When you come together, each of you has
    a hymn, or a word of instruction, a revelation, a tongue or an
    interpretation. Everything must be done so that the church may be built up."

    [1 Cor 14:26–35]: https://biblehub.com/niv/1_corinthians/14-26.htm "What
    then shall we say, brothers and sisters? When you come together, each of you
    has a hymn, or a word of instruction, a revelation, a tongue or an
    interpretation. Everything must be done so that the church may be built up.
    If anyone speaks in a tongue, two—or at the most three—should speak, one at
    a time, and someone must interpret. If there is no interpreter, the speaker
    should keep quiet in the church and speak to himself and to God. Two or
    three prophets should speak, and the others should weigh carefully what is
    said. And if a revelation comes to someone who is sitting down, the first
    speaker should stop. For you can all prophesy in turn so that everyone may
    be instructed and encouraged. The spirits of prophets are subject to the
    control of prophets. For God is not a God of disorder but of peace—as in all
    the congregations of the Lord’s people. Women should remain silent in the
    churches. They are not allowed to speak, but must be in submission, as the
    law says. If they want to inquire about something, they should ask their own
    husbands at home; for it is disgraceful for a woman to speak in the church."

    [1 Cor 16:19]: https://biblehub.com/niv/1_corinthians/16-19.htm "The
    churches in the province of Asia send you greetings. Aquila and Priscilla
    greet you warmly in the Lord, and so does the church that meets at their
    house."

    [Eph 1:22–23]: https://biblehub.com/niv/ephesians/1-22.htm "And God placed
    all things under his feet and appointed him to be head over everything for
    the church, which is his body, the fullness of him who fills everything in
    every way."

    [Eph 5:19]:  https://biblehub.com/niv/ephesians/5-19.htm "speaking to one
    another with psalms, hymns, and songs from the Spirit. Sing and make music
    from your heart to the Lord,"

    [Phm 1:2]: https://biblehub.com/niv/philemon/1-2.htm "also to Apphia our
    sister and Archippus our fellow soldier—and to the church that meets in your
    home:"

    [Col 3:16]: https://biblehub.com/niv/colossians/3-16.htm "Let the message of
    Christ dwell among you richly as you teach and admonish one another with all
    wisdom through psalms, hymns, and songs from the Spirit, singing to God with
    gratitude in your hearts."

    [Col 4:2–4]: https://biblehub.com/niv/colossians/4-2.htm "Devote yourselves
    to prayer, being watchful and thankful. And pray for us, too, that God may
    open a door for our message, so that we may proclaim the mystery of Christ,
    for which I am in chains. Pray that I may proclaim it clearly, as I should."

    [Col 4:5–6]: https://biblehub.com/niv/colossians/4-5.htm "Be wise in the way
    you act toward outsiders; make the most of every opportunity. Let your
    conversation be always full of grace, seasoned with salt, so that you may
    know how to answer everyone."

    [Col 4:15]: https://biblehub.com/niv/colossians/4-15.htm "Give my greetings
    to the brothers and sisters at Laodicea, and to Nympha and the church in her
    house."

    [1 Thess 5:12–13]: https://biblehub.com/niv/1_thessalonians/5-12.htm "Now we
    ask you, brothers and sisters, to acknowledge those who work hard among you,
    who care for you in the Lord and who admonish you. Hold them in the highest
    regard in love because of their work. Live in peace with each other."

    [2 Thess 2:15]: https://biblehub.com/niv/2_thessalonians/2-15.htm "So then,
    brothers and sisters, stand firm and hold fast to the teachings we passed on
    to you, whether by word of mouth or by letter."

    [1 Tim 4:13]: https://biblehub.com/niv/1_timothy/14-13.htm "Until I come,
    devote yourself to the public reading of Scripture, to preaching and to
    teaching."

    [2 Tim 2:2]: https://biblehub.com/niv/2_timothy/2-2.htm "And the things you
    have heard me say in the presence of many witnesses entrust to reliable
    people who will also be qualified to teach others."

    [Heb 13:17]: https://biblehub.com/niv/hebrews/13-17.htm "Have confidence in
    your leaders and submit to their authority, because they keep watch over you
    as those who must give an account. Do this so that their work will be a joy,
    not a burden, for that would be of no benefit to you."

    [James 3:1]:  https://biblehub.com/niv/james/3-1.htm "Not many of you should
    become teachers, my fellow believers, because you know that we who teach
    will be judged more strictly."

    [1 Pet 3:15–16]: https://biblehub.com/niv/1_peter/3-15.htm "But in your
    hearts revere Christ as Lord. Always be prepared to give an answer to
    everyone who asks you to give the reason for the hope that you have. But do
    this with gentleness and respect, keeping a clear conscience, so that those
    who speak maliciously against your good behavior in Christ may be ashamed of
    their slander."



    We are a group of Christians seeking to fellowship like the early church, meeting in our homes (<cite class="nowrap">[Rom
    16:5]</cite>; <cite class="nowrap">[1 Cor 16:19]</cite>; <cite
    class="nowrap">[Col 4:15]</cite>; <cite class="nowrap">[Phm 1:2]</cite>;
    <cite class="nowrap">[2 Thess 2:15]</cite>; <cite class="nowrap">[1 Cor
    11:2]</cite>) and encouraging everyone to participate (<cite
    class="nowrap">[1 Cor 14:26]</cite>; <cite class="nowrap">[Eph 5:19]</cite>;
    <cite class="nowrap">[Col 3:16]</cite>).


    We meet at various locations around Gladstone, Calliope and <span
    class="nowrap">Tannum Sands</span>, and our Sunday meetings typically
    include:


    <div class="list-circle list-fix_indent"></div>


    * Encouraging one another in song, Scripture & testimonies.<br><cite
    class="nowrap">[1 Cor 14:26]</cite>; <cite class="nowrap">[Eph 5:19]</cite>;
    <cite class="nowrap">[Col 3:16]</cite>; <cite class="nowrap">[1 Tim
    4:13]</cite>.

    * Breaking up into small groups for prayer & encouragement.<br><cite
    class="nowrap">[1 Cor 14:15]</cite>; <cite class="nowrap">[1 Cor
    14:26]</cite>; <cite class="nowrap">[Col 4:2–4]</cite>.

    * Bible teaching led by gifted men.<br><cite class="nowrap">[1 Cor
    14:26–35]</cite>; <cite class="nowrap">[2 Tim 2:2]</cite>; <cite
    class="nowrap">[James 3:1]</cite>.

    * A monthly celebration of the Lord’s Supper as a full meal.<br><cite
    class="nowrap">[1 Cor 11:17–33]</cite>; <cite class="nowrap">[Acts
    20:7]</cite>.


    We believe that Jesus is the head of the church, which is his body (<cite
    class="nowrap">[Eph 1:22–23]</cite>).  As a body, we
    encourage one another according to our spiritual gifts (<cite
    class="nowrap">[1 Cor 12 to 14]</cite>), promoting genuine relationships and
    a family atmosphere with parents and children worshiping together.  Major church decisions are prayerfully
    made under the headship of Christ by elder-led congregational consensus
    (<cite class="nowrap">[Acts 15:22]</cite>; <cite class="nowrap">[1 Thess
    5:12–13]</cite>; <cite class="nowrap">[Heb 13:17]</cite>).


    The early church was also burdened for those who do not yet know Jesus
    (<cite class="nowrap">[1 Cor 14:22–25]</cite>), and so we are encouraged to
    be evangelistic in every area of life, impacting our community and culture
    for Christ (<cite class="nowrap">[Col 4:5–6]</cite>; <cite class="nowrap">[1
    Pet 3:15–16]</cite>; <cite class="nowrap">[Luke 14:13]</cite>; <cite
    class="nowrap">[Luke 14:21]</cite>; <cite class="nowrap">[Luke
    14:23]</cite>).


    In essentials there is to be unity, in nonessentials liberty, and in all
    things love. With regard to the essentials, all of us who participate in and
    contribute to our church meetings firmly uphold and bind ourselves to the
    following core truths of the Christian faith:


    <div class="list-decimal list-fix_indent"></div>


    1. The Bible is the Word of God and without error.

    2. There is one God, eternally existing as the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.

    3. God is good and created a perfect world.

    4. Adam’s sin brought death and suffering and separation from God.

    5. Jesus is fully God and fully man, born of the virgin Mary, and without
    sin.

    6. Jesus died on a cross to pay the penalty for our sins and conquered death
    through his resurrection.

    7. We must repent and turn to God and take up our own cross daily to be a
    disciple of Jesus.

    8. We are saved by God’s grace through faith in Jesus, not by our good
    deeds.

    9. Jesus will one day return to judge the world and establish his Messianic
    kingdom.

    10. There will be a new heavens and a new earth, restored to their original
    perfection.
